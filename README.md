# Gene.js

This is a JavaScript implementation of a Genetic Algorithm that can run 4 different fitness functions:

1. **One-Max**: Counts the number of 1's in a chromosome
2. **Target**: Scores based on similarity with a target chromosome
3. **Deceptive**: Attempts to decieve the evolution process by awarding poor (all zero) members high fitness scores
4. **Knapsack**: Finds the total value of items in a knapsack that don't exceed its maximum capacity

The results for each of the above can be found here: https://lukegib.github.io/gene.js/

Simply click on the datasets name at the top of the graph to hide/display it.
